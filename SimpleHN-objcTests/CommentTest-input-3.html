&gt;So Automattic, maker of the largest open source PHP CMS in the world has thrown out PHP in favor of node.js for their own site.<p>No, they kept PHP for the backend, and created a new front-end with node and JS. And that&#x27;s just for the admin pages.<p>&gt;<i>If they&#x27;re leading by example, we should ditch WordPress.org and PHP in favor of node.js web apps and frameworks too, since it&#x27;s the way of the future?</i><p>Perhaps. Do you expect Automattic to tell you what your stack should be?<p>Besides, if node&#x2F;Js is the &quot;way of the future&quot; then there&#x27;s no need to ditch &quot;wordPress.org&quot; since it has already embraced that future.
